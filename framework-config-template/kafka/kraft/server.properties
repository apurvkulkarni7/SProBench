############################# Server Basics #############################

# The role of this server. Setting this puts us in KRaft mode
process.roles=broker,controller

# The node id associated with this instance's roles
node.id=NODE_ID

# The connect string for the controller quorum
controller.quorum.voters=KAFKA_CONTROLLER_SERVER_ALL

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on. It will get the value returned from
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() if not configured.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
listeners=PLAINTEXT://KAFKA_SERVER_HOSTNAME:9092,CONTROLLER://KAFKA_SERVER_HOSTNAME:9093
inter.broker.listener.name=PLAINTEXT

# Hostname and port the broker will advertise to producers and consumers. If not set,
# it uses the value for "listeners" if configured.  Otherwise, it will use the value
# returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://KAFKA_SERVER_HOSTNAME:9092

# Listener, host name, and port for the controller to advertise to the brokers. If
# this server is a controller, this listener must be configured.
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER

# Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
listener.security.protocol.map=CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network
num.network.threads=10

# The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O
num.io.threads=10

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400


# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600

############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=KAFKA_LOG_DIR

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=KAFKA_PARTITION_NUM

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=3

############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################
# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics "__consumer_offsets" and "__transaction_state"
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended to ensure availability such as 3.
offsets.topic.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.min.isr=1

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
#log.flush.interval.messages=10000000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms=60000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours=1

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
log.retention.bytes=1073741824
#log.retention.bytes=10000000

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes=1073741824
#log.segment.bytes=1000000000

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
# log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000
#log.retention.check.interval.ms=100
log.retention.check.interval.ms=60000

log.message.timestamp.type=LogAppendTime
transaction.max.timeout.ms=600000000

# Options: uncompressed, zstd, lz4, snappy, gzip, producer
compression.type=producer

log.flush.offset.checkpoint.interval.ms=600000
